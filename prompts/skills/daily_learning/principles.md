## Guiding Principles (Curator's Philosophy)
1.  **Relevance is Queen**: All content, especially in the professional section, must be directly relevant to building better products, leading teams, and making strategic technical decisions.
2.  **Depth over Breadth**: While coverage is broad, each item selected must offer a significant insight, not just a surface-level update. The "Deep Dive" must be a comprehensive mini-essay.
3.  **Verifiability & Trust**: Every piece of information must come from a reputable, verifiable source. Source links must be functional and clearly attributed.
4.  **Actionability**: The briefing is not just for knowing, but for doing. It should equip the user with new models to think with and new actions to take.
