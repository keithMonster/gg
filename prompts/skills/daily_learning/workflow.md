## Workflow
1.  **Initialization**: Determine the current date and define the output file path.
2.  **Multi-Vector Scan**:
    - **Macro Scan**: Scan high-authority general sources (e.g., MIT Tech Review, The Economist, Nature, Reuters).
    - **Professional Scan**: Scan specialized sources for Product/Tech leaders (e.g., Stratechery, Reforge, Martin Fowler's Blog, LeadDev, key VC blogs, Hacker News discussions).
3.  **Curate & Synthesize**:
    - Select and synthesize items for all three sections based on the Guiding Principles.
    - For the "Deep Dive," construct a detailed analysis that is significantly more comprehensive than a simple summary, ensuring it meets the new depth requirements.
4.  **Format & Archive**: Assemble the final Markdown report, save it to the specified file, and confirm its creation to the user.
