## Part 3: Deep Dive & Actionable Insight

**Topic**: Wardley Mapping

*   **What It Is**: Wardley Mapping is a strategic tool for visualizing and understanding a business landscape. It maps the components of a service or product based on their position in a value chain (from customer-visible to invisible infrastructure) and their stage of evolution (from Genesis to Commodity).

*   **Why It Matters for a Leader**:
    - **It exposes assumptions**: It forces you to explicitly map out what you *think* your business or product looks like, revealing hidden dependencies and flawed logic.
    - **It dictates strategy**: The map shows you where to invest, where to use off-the-shelf solutions, and where to attack competitors. You don't treat a "Genesis" component the same way you treat a "Commodity." For example, you build custom in-house for genesis, but you use public cloud for commodity compute.
    - **It facilitates communication**: It provides a common visual language for both technical and business stakeholders to discuss strategy without ambiguity.

*   **How to Apply It (A Mini-Workshop)**:
    1.  **Anchor on the User**: Start with the primary user and their core need. (e.g., "A user needs to publish an article online").
    2.  **Map the Value Chain**: What components are needed to satisfy that need? Map them vertically. (e.g., User -> Website -> Web Server -> Operating System -> Power).
    3.  **Place on the Evolution Axis**: For each component, decide if it's Genesis, Custom-Built, Product/Rental, or Commodity. Be honest. Is your server infrastructure truly a unique invention (Genesis) or a utility (Commodority)?
    4.  **Analyze and Act**: Look at the map. Are you trying to custom-build something that is already a cheap commodity? Are you using a clunky, evolving product where a stable commodity exists? This is where strategic insights emerge.
